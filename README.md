The following folders were created during the writing of the tutorials for the multichain-deploy plugins. They are left here for demonstration purposes of the contracts & tests that were created and scripts that were run. 

Feel free to fork the repo to deploy your own examples.

You can read through the tutorials [here](https://tim-hch.medium.com/how-to-deploy-unified-cross-chain-contract-addresses-from-single-source-blockchain-gas-using-the-08edf5e0ec17) and [here](https://tim-hch.medium.com/how-to-deploy-cross-chain-contracts-to-same-address-from-single-chain-gas-using-multichain-deploy-dd3b1665f028).
